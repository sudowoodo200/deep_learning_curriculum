# Chapter 5: Modeling Objectives

Language models are generally trained using a log-likelihood/cross-entropy objective, but there are several other useful objectives for representation learning and generative modeling.

This chapter is included for breadth, but it can be skipped if you want to focus on language models. It is not that detailed because I am not that familiar with these topics.

- [Contrastive Representation Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/) - Contrastive objectives are an important class of training objectives that are used for representation learning. The first section of this post, entitled "Contrastive Training Objectives", covers some popular contrastive objectives.

## Suggested exercise

Train a contrastive CNN on MNIST using a contrastive objective of your choice. Hold out a few examples from each class from the training set. Once your model has finished training, use your held-out examples to measure the classification accuracy of your model: for each test example, measure the similarity of the test example to each held-out example, and choose the class with the highest average similarity.
